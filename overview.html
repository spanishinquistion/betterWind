--></ul></div>

<!--WC: removing glossary until we have one-->

<h2 id="toc_0">Background</h2>
<p>There is no shortage of online sites with instructions about how to get started with wind turbine siting. A very thorough source is <a href = "https://windexchange.energy.gov/projects" target="_blank">energy.gov</a>. The information is limited to the US and it's coasts but provides the basic information one needs to get started. On the <a href = "https://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/site-selection" target="_blank">Site Selection</a> page you can learn more about the type of the information provided by OpenWind.</p>

<p>The number one rule of putting up a turbine is understanding the wind conditions at your site. </p>

<p>The best way to do this is to do a wind measurement campaign at your site. If you search for information regarding wind measurements, you will find lots of commercial offerings. This is the best method to get information regarding wind conditions for your site, but that involves time, commitment and expense. The standard campaign is one year and ideally uses a measurement tower of the same height as your proposed turbine.</p>

<p>A less expensive way to get started is to find existing local information. The site information should be as close as possible to your potential site.  Information is available for most countries at various resolutions, but the data is normally raw data; wind measurements and wind direction time histories. This data is usually provided without the anlaysis necessary to make it usable to non professionals. And that is what we provide. </p>

 <p>Openwinddata uses the high quality verified raw data from nearby sites from the <a href = "https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html." target="_blank">Deutscher WetterDienst</a> and uses industry standard methods to determine the viability of producing wind energy at a given site.</p>


<h2 id="toc_1">Evaluate Your Location</h2>

<!--WC, to Eds:: This intro section is what needs editorial massaging. We need to transition the customer from practical everyday language to technical specific. It doesn't need a ton of work and doesn't need to be significantly longer. Just friendly and readable, and by the end of the 2nd paragraph the customer is comfortably reading copy in the tone of the rest of the site.-->

<!--WC, to Eds: We also need to set the point of view. Is there a "We", or is everything 3rd-person OpenWind? Is there a "You" or do we create a 3rd-person Customer?-->

<p>Does it makes sense to install a wind turbine at a given site?</p>
<p>
This is not a simple question. The two most important factors are the wind conditions and the type of turbine.
Wind measurements are used to calculate the potential yield of a wind turbine at a site and that is what our data analysis on this site provides.</p><!-- The data used for these calculations is from the DWD <a href = "https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html." target="_blank">(Deutscher WetterDienst)</a>.-->

<p>For turbine data we use a few representative <a href="methods.html#toc_8">turbine models</a> to provide values for easy comparisons. The turbines are provided to put some useful units to the results, like kWh. These are the units used in the measurement and sale of electricity universally. So you can compare results for various turbine sizes with the same information you can find on your electricity bill.</p>
<!--OpenWind provides answers to the questions about wind at the site. OpenWind uses reliable data to provide the analysis needed to determine the viability of turbine at a site. You can use our analysis and the data provided by the DWD to determine if a wind turbine at your site is viable. We can estimate how much energy in kWh you should produce. </p>
<!--
<p>Note that we  provide a feasibility study and do not determine the economic benefit or profit/loss of a wind turbine at a given site.
WC, to Eds: This is a bit unhelpful and could use some friendliness. Offer some help on how a customer go about doing the things that we don't offer, etc.</p>-->

<h2 id="toc_2">How to Use Our Analysis</h2>

<h3 id="toc_3">Step 1</h3>

<h4 id="toc_4">Evaluate your free preliminary report</h4>

<p>We provide preliminary data for free. Find your nearest location and which includes helpful explanations for interpreting data visualization and assessing your site. This is the basic look at a site using very rough data. It is not data to be used to make decisions, but can be used to determine if the site could be interesting. 
<!--WC, to Eds: We'll need an explanation of what the preliminary data is and what a preliminary report is. What a report contains, how it's generated, how up-to-date it is, and what you can do with it. We also should note its limitations and hint at the detailed report (without stepping on that section's toes and being repetitive). Cover a bit of the "why" as to why you'd go on to a next step.
-->
<!--Not too long, we want people to be able to read through these steps fairly quickly.--></p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Step 2</h3>

<h4 id="toc_6">Purchase a detailed report</h4>

<p>When you want to know more about your site, we provide a more thorough analysis using higher fidelity measurements. Higher fidelity means more accurate measurement data and more accurate analysis predictions. A detailed report resembles the structure of the preliminary report, but with additional report elements and more precise data. We generate this analysis as a service upon request. <a href="mailto:info@openwinddata.com ?subject=General Inquiry" >Contact us</a> for more information.
<!--WC, to Eds: Again, a bit more detail needed here. How the detailed report is so much better, how that's useful for planning/investment. --></p>
