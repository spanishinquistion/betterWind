<h2 id="toc_1">We Help Evaluate Your Wind Location</h2>

<!--WC, to Eds:: This intro section is what needs editorial massaging. We need to transition the customer from practical everyday language to technical specific. It doesn't need a ton of work and doesn't need to be significantly longer. Just friendly and readable, and by the end of the 2nd paragraph the customer is comfortably reading copy in the tone of the rest of the site.-->

<!--WC, to Eds: We also need to set the point of view. Is there a "We", or is everything 3rd-person OpenWind? Is there a "You" or do we create a 3rd-person Customer?-->

<p>Many people want to know if it makes sense to install a wind turbine at their site. This is not a simple question, it is site dependent first and foremost. What data is available at the site with respect to wind? What kind of turbine will be installed? Will the power be used by the owner or sold to the grid?</p>

<p>OpenWind provides answers to the questions about wind at the site. OpenWind uses reliable data to provide the analysis needed to determine the viability of turbine at a site. You can use our analysis and the data provided by the DWD to determine if a wind turbine at your site is viable. We can estimate how much energy in kWh you should produce. </p>

<p>What you do with the energy is up to you, you can use it or sell it. We can not tell you how much money you will make.
<!--WC, to Eds: This is a bit unhelpful and could use some friendliness. Offer some help on how a customer go about doing the things that we don't offer, etc--></p>

<h2 id="toc_2">How to Use Our Data</h2>

<h3 id="toc_3">Step 1</h3>

<h4 id="toc_4">Evaluate your free preliminary report</h4>

<p>We provide preliminary data for free. Find your nearest location and which includes helpful explanations for interpreting data visualization and assessing your site. 
<!--WC, to Eds: We'll need an explanation of what the preliminary data is and what a preliminary report is. What a report contains, how it's generated, how up-to-date it is, and what you can do with it. We also should note its limitations and hint at the detailed report (without stepping on that section's toes and being repetitive). Cover a bit of the "why" as to why you'd go on to a next step.
-->
<!--Not too long, we want people to be able to read through these steps fairly quickly.--></p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Step 2</h3>

<h4 id="toc_6">Purchase a detailed report</h4>

<p>When you want to know more about your site, we provide a more thorough analysis using higher fidelity measurements. A detailed report resembles the structure of the preliminary report, but with additional report elements and more precise data. We generate this analysis as a service upon request. <a href="">Contact us</a> for more information.
<!--WC, to Eds: Again, a bit more detail needed here. How the detailed report is so much better, how that's useful for planning/investment. --></p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Step 3</h3>

<h4 id="toc_8">Begin your implementation</h4>

<p>Using the detailed report, you can secure financing and begin working with professionals to finance and start work at your site.
<!--WC, to Eds:  We should include a high level description of what this would entail - mostly to depict a holistic picture and make things real, but we also need to frame the value of Open Wind at that point. Will they still use our data for this location, or is it less valuable at that point?
